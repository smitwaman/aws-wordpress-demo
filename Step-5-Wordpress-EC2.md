Here are the detailed steps to launch a WordPress EC2 instance in the public subnet:

1. **Navigate to EC2 Dashboard**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the EC2 dashboard.

2. **Launch Instance**:
   - Click on "Launch Instance" to start the instance creation wizard.

3. **Choose AMI**:
   - Select an existing Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that includes WordPress pre-installed. You can find WordPress AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or use a custom AMI if you have one.
   - Click on "Select".

4. **Choose Instance Type**:
   - Choose the desired instance type based on your requirements (e.g., t2.micro, t3.small, etc.).
   - Click on "Next: Configure Instance Details".

5. **Configure Instance Details**:
   - Select the VPC where your public subnet resides.
   - Choose the public subnet where you want to launch the instance.
   - Ensure "Auto-assign Public IP" is set to "Enable" so that the instance gets a public IP address.
   - Click on "Next: Add Storage".

6. **Add Storage**:
   - Configure the instance storage based on your requirements. The default settings are usually sufficient for WordPress.
   - Click on "Next: Add Tags".

7. **Add Tags**:
   - (Optional) Add any tags to your instance for easier identification.
   - Click on "Next: Configure Security Group".

8. **Configure Security Group**:
   - Create a new security group or select an existing one.
   - Ensure the security group allows inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) to allow web traffic to the WordPress site.
   - Add a custom inbound rule to allow traffic from the security group associated with the RDS instance on the MySQL port (default is 3306). This allows the EC2 instance to communicate with the RDS instance.
   - Click on "Review and Launch".

9. **Review and Launch**:
   - Review the instance configuration to ensure everything is set up correctly.
   - Click on "Launch".

10. **Choose Key Pair**:
    - Select an existing key pair or create a new one to connect to the instance securely.
    - Click on "Launch Instances".

11. **Access WordPress Instance**:
    - Wait for the instance to be launched and reach the "running" state.
    - Once the instance is running, note down its public IP address or public DNS name.

12. **Configure WordPress to Connect to RDS**:
    - SSH into the EC2 instance using the key pair you selected.
    - Configure WordPress to connect to the RDS instance by editing the `wp-config.php` file.
    - Update the database host with the RDS endpoint, and provide the database username and password.
    - Save the changes.

13. **Update Security Group of WordPress Instance**:
    - Go to the EC2 dashboard and select the security group associated with the WordPress instance.
    - Add an outbound rule to allow traffic to the RDS instance's security group on port 3306 (MySQL).
    - Save the changes.

Now, your WordPress EC2 instance is set up in the public subnet, accessible from the internet, and configured to connect to the RDS instance securely. Users can access your WordPress site using the public IP address or DNS name of the EC2 instance.
