Here are the detailed steps to create an RDS instance with a predefined security group for RDS:

1. **Navigate to RDS Dashboard**:
   - Log in to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the RDS dashboard.

2. **Choose Engine Type**:
   - Click on "Create database".
   - Select the engine type you want to use (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

3. **Choose Use Case**:
   - Choose a use case that fits your needs (e.g., Dev/Test, Production, etc.).

4. **Specify DB Details**:
   - Choose the appropriate version of the database engine.
   - Specify the DB instance class (instance type).
   - Enter the desired database identifier (DB instance identifier).
   - Set the master username and password for the database.
   - You can leave other settings as default or configure them based on your requirements.

5. **Configure Advanced Settings**:
   - Expand the "Additional configuration" section.
   - Select the appropriate VPC where your private subnet resides.
   - Choose the private subnet(s) where you want to place the RDS instance.
   - Configure the database port, storage, backup settings, and other advanced options as needed.

6. **Set Up Security Group**:
   - In the "Network & Security" section, select the option to "Choose existing VPC security group".
   - Select the security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group of the WordPress EC2 instance. This security group should have the necessary inbound rules configured to allow access from the WordPress EC2 instance.
   - You can keep the outbound rules as default (allow all traffic).

7. **Review and Launch**:
   - Review all the configurations to ensure they are correct.
   - Click on "Create database" to launch the RDS instance.

8. **Wait for the RDS Instance to be Available**:
   - It may take several minutes for the RDS instance to be created and become available. You can monitor its status on the RDS dashboard. Wait until the status changes to "Available".

Once the RDS instance is available, it will be accessible from the private subnet(s) specified during the configuration. It will also allow inbound traffic from the security group of the WordPress EC2 instance, ensuring that your WordPress application can connect to the database.
